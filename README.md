## Installation

First, make sure you have your Visual Studio and .NET 8 environment set up for .NET MAUI development. If not, follow the [setup instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation). Then make sure you have your [Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?pivots=devices-android) or [iOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?pivots=devices-ios) platform set up for deployment of the application.

Once everything is set up, you can clone the repo and run the application via Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
